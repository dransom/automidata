# Automatidata Data Analysis & Dashboard

## Overview

This is intended to be a quick EDA & dashboarding exercise. The goal is to explore, organize, and understand the data provided. There are 3 main outputs for the project:

* EDA & cleaning
* Select and build visuzaliations
* Share results via dashboard in Tableau
* Executive summary of results

## Background on the Automatidata scenario

Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

**Note:** This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior. 

## Data Dictionary

This project uses a dataset called 2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv. It contains data gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. For each trip, there are many different data variables gathered. 

The dataset contains:

**408,294 rows** – each row represents a different trip

**18 columns**
